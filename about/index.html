	<h1>A little about myself...</h1>
	<p>I am a 4<sup>th</sup> year undergraduate student at IIIT Delhi. I am pursuing a bachelor's of technology in computer science 
		and applied mathematics. I am primarily interested in the applications of machine learning towards computer vision. I have recently worked in areas
		such as domain adaptation, person re-identification, adversarial perturbations and object tracking in videos.<a href="/about"></a></p>
	<p>Apart from academics, I really enjoy RPGs, reading comics, novels and fiction in general.<a href="/about"></a></p>
